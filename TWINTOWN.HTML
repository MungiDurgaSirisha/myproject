                            <h2>TWIN TOWN</h2>
                            <p>Is it true that you might find your doppelganger somewhere out there in the world? Sometimes, some news strikes us so hard that the next obvious thing we do is think hard, out of sheer bewilderment. Among the most mysterious things going on in the world, the news of 220 sets of twins growing up in a village in India is very astounding.</p>

                                <p>In 2008, 300 women delivered healthy babies and, out of those deliveries, 15 pairs of twins were born in the village. As per the population census, 60 pairs of twins were born in the past five years in Kodinhi village. Apparently, the rate of twins is increasing with every passing year, and is expected to break the previous records in 2017!
